                        American Builder Hardwood Floor did an incredible job refinishing our 100-year-old hardwood floors in Newton. They brought them back to life beautifully and were very professional throughout the process.

                        Excellent workmanship and fair pricing. They installed new hardwood flooring in our Quincy home and we couldn't be happier. Highly recommend for anyone in the South Shore area.

                        Fast, clean, and professional service. They repaired water damage to our hardwood floors in Cambridge and you can't even tell there was ever an issue. Great communication too.

                        After getting quotes from several companies, American Builder offered the best value and delivered exceptional quality. The refinishing job on our Boston condo was flawless.
