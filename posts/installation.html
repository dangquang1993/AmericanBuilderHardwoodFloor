                <div class="timeline-body">
                    <p class="text-muted">Are you thinking about the material that you would want to use for the
                        flooring in your house? You’ve considered carpet flooring but decided against it because of how
                        difficult the upkeep would be. You’ve also decided against having tiles aside from the bathroom
                        and the kitchen. But when it comes to the living room, the hallway, and the bedrooms, you’re in
                        a dilemma. Why not give the hardwood flooring a try? If you want them installed in your house,
                        consider hiring a residential flooring expert such as American Builder Hardwood Floor. We can
                        properly install hardwood for the floors in your house in Quincy, MA.</p>

                    The Benefits of Hardwood</h2>
                <div class="timeline-body">
                    <p class="text-muted">Having hardwood for your flooring installed in your house brings a lot of
                        benefits. For one, this type of material is a lot sturdier than others. Unlike tiles that can
                        get damaged and chipped from physical impact, hardwood can withstand impact. Although they can
                        get scratched or dented, it would take a lot of force to do so. Second, solid hardwood is easy
                        to maintain. You can clean the floors by sweeping or vacuuming. You won’t have a hard time
                        removing dirt and dust that is stuck on the surface. Once you have decided, hire residential
                        flooring experts to do the installation for you.

                        Our hardwood flooring service will make sure that the solid hardwood panels are installed
                        properly for the floors of your home. The most important part of the installation process is
                        finding the materials. We can suggest suppliers that offer top-quality materials at affordable
                        rates. We’ll measure each room where the hardwood panels will be installed and make an estimate
                        on how much should be purchased. As for the installation, we will prepare the floor, place the
                        panels, hand-nail the rolls, and staple the boards. By the time we finish, you’ll have hardwood
                        flooring properly installed in your home.
