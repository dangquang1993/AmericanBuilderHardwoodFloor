    <br>
    
    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <h2>Understanding Hardwood Flooring Grades</h2>
    <p>Hardwood flooring is graded based on the natural characteristics visible in the wood. These grades don't indicate quality or durability - they simply describe the appearance. Here are the most common grades you'll encounter:</p>
    
    <table class="grade-table">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th style="padding: 10x">Grade</th>
                <th style="padding: 10x">Appearance</th>
                <th style="padding: 10x">Best For</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                 <td style="padding: 10px"><strong>Clear</strong></td>
                 <td style="padding: 10px">Nearly uniform appearance with minimal knots or color variations</td>
                 <td style="padding: 10px">Formal spaces, modern designs</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                 <td style="padding: 10px"><strong>Select</strong></td>
                 <td style="padding: 10px">Some color variation but few knots</td>
                 <td style="padding: 10px">Traditional to contemporary styles</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                 <td style="padding: 10px"><strong>Character   </strong></td>
                 <td style="padding: 10px">Blend of select and #1 common features</td>
                 <td style="padding: 10px">Balance of refinement and character</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                 <td style="padding: 10px"><strong>#1 Common</strong></td>
                 <td style="padding: 10px">Moderate color variation and small knots</td>
                 <td style="padding: 10px">Casual, rustic, or cottage styles</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                 <td style="padding: 10px"><strong>#2 Common</strong></td>
                 <td style="padding: 10px">Pronounced color variation and larger knots</td>
                 <td style="padding: 10px">Very rustic or reclaimed looks</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    
    <h3>How to Choose the Right Grade</h3>
    <p>When selecting a hardwood grade, consider:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Your design style:</strong> Clean grades suit modern spaces, while character grades work well in rustic or traditional homes</li>
        <li><strong>Room size:</strong> Higher grades (clear/select) can make small rooms feel larger</li>
        <li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> More character means minor scratches are less noticeable</li>
        <li><strong>Budget:</strong> Clear grades typically cost more than character grades</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>At <strong>American Builder Hardwood Floor</strong>, we keep samples of all grades to help you visualize how they'll look in your space.</p>
