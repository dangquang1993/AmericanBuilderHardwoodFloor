        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Engineered hardwood floors are a popular choice for homeowners who want the beauty of solid hardwood with added durability and versatility.

In this blog, weâ€™ll explore what engineered hardwood is, its benefits, and why it might be the perfect choice for your home.</p>
     

     
        <h2>What Is Engineered Hardwood?</h2>
        <p>Engineered hardwood is made up of multiple layers of wood. The top layer is real hardwood, while the core layers are typically made of plywood or high-density fiberboard (HDF). This construction makes engineered hardwood more stable and resistant to moisture compared to solid hardwood.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Top Layer:</strong> Real hardwood veneer for a natural look and feel.</li>
            <li><strong>Core Layers:</strong> Plywood or HDF for added stability and durability.</li>
        </ul>
