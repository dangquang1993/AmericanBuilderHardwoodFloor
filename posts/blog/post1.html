            <li><strong>White Oak:</strong> Slightly harder and more durable than red oak, white oak has a lighter color with subtle gray undertones, making it ideal for contemporary designs.</li>

        <p><strong>Best For:</strong> High-traffic areas, traditional and modern homes.</p>
            <br>

                <ul>

                <p><strong >Cherry</strong> is a luxurious hardwood known for its rich, reddish-brown color that deepens over time. It has a fine, straight grain and a smooth texture.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Aging:</strong> Cherry wood darkens with exposure to light, adding character and depth to your floors.</li>
