                <div class="timeline-body">
                    <p class="text-muted">Investing in professional flooring repair work offers several key benefits.
                        These include:</p>
                    <ul class="text-muted">
                        <li>
                            <p class="text-muted"><b>Cost savings:</b> Repairing damaged hardwood floors is typically
                                much more affordable than replacing them entirely.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p class="text-muted"><b>Aesthetic appeal:</b> Restoring your floors’ appearance can enhance the beauty and overall aesthetic of your home or business space.</p>

                            <p class="text-muted"><b>Environmentally friendly:</b> Repairing and restoring existing
                                floors reduces the demand for new wood materials, making it an environmentally friendly choice.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
