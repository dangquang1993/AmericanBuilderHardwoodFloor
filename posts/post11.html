            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Living in New England means dealing with a unique climate that can be tough on <strong>hardwood floors</strong>. With cold, dry winters and warm, humid summers, itâ€™s essential to choose a wood species that can handle these fluctuations without warping or gapping. At <strong>American Builder Hardwood Floor</strong>, we have years of experience working with local homeowners and have identified the best flooring options for our region, the <strong>greater Boston area</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Top Hardwood Choices for New England</h2>

            <h4>1. Red Oak</h4>
            <p>A classic choice for a reason, Red Oak is known for its durability and resistance to wear and tear. It has a Janka hardness rating of around 1290, making it tough enough for high-traffic areas. Its strong grain pattern also helps to hide minor scratches and dents. More importantly, Red Oak is relatively stable and adapts well to changes in humidity, which is a key consideration in Massachusetts.</p>

            <h4>2. White Oak</h4>
            <p>Slightly harder than Red Oak (Janka rating of 1360), White Oak is another excellent option. It has a subtler, straighter grain and is more water-resistant due to its closed-grain structure. This makes it a great choice for kitchens and entryways. White Oakâ€™s stability and classic look make it a popular choice for homes throughout the <strong>greater Boston area</strong>.</p>

            <h4>3. Maple</h4>
            <p>Maple is one of the hardest domestic woods (Janka rating of 1450), making it incredibly durable and resistant to dents. Its light, creamy color and subtle grain pattern can brighten up any room, creating a clean and modern look. While it can be more sensitive to humidity changes than oak, proper acclimation and installation by professionals like us can ensure a long-lasting, beautiful <strong>hardwood floor</strong>.</p>

            <h4>4. Hickory</h4>
            <p>If youâ€™re looking for a floor that can stand up to anything, Hickory is a fantastic choice. With a Janka rating of 1820, itâ€™s one of the hardest and most durable domestic woods available. Its distinctive grain pattern and color variations can add a rustic charm to your home. Hickory is also very stable, making it well-suited for the New England climate.</p>
